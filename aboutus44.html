             <h2>"What an unbelievable adventure we shared with our YPO friends and their families. We were immediately immersed in the beauty of Africa and every day brought new and exciting experiences. First class accommodations, stimulating education and deepening of friendships were the highlights for me. More highlights? Spotting a leopard in the treetops, rainbows over Victoria Falls, tribal face paint while sipping South African wines, pre-dawn bush rides, snuggled with my family under blankets, relaxing with friends, surprises at sundown, watching the children absorb it all and knowing we were in a moment of time with them. Thank you Bridgit and Steve for the amazing introduction to your beautiful continent. "</h2>
